# Inclusive Terminology in IETF Documents

Some choices of terminology that might seem harmless to some members of the community have painful connotations for others.  To ensure that the Internet standards process is open and welcoming for everyone, we should avoid such terminology in favor of more inclusive (and often more accurate!) options.

Here are some of the most common problematic terms and some suggested alternatives:

| Avoid                                 | Better                                            |
|:--------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| whitelist                             | allowlist                                         |
| blacklist	                            | blocklist, denylist                               |
| master/slave                          | leader/follower, primary/replica, primary/standby |
| grandfathered	                        | legacy status                                     |
| Gendered terms (e.g., guys)           | Folks, people, you all, y'all                     |
| Gendered pronouns (e.g., he/him/his)  | They, them, their                                 |
| Man hours	                            | Person hours, engineer hours, staff hours         |
| Sanity check                          | Quick check, confidence check                     |
| Crazy                                 | Unexpected, surprising, puzzling                  |
| Dummy value                           | Placeholder value, sample value                   |

This list is obviously not comprehensive.  In general, authors and reviewers
should try to make sure they use language that is inclusive along a few
dimensions:

* Gender
* Age
* Ability
* Ethnicity

## Background: Elsewhere on the Internet

The IETF is not alone in trying to make its terminology more inclusive.  Some
peer organizations have published guidelines for writing more inclusive
documentation, for example:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TwitterEng/status/1278733305190342656)
* [Google](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation)
* [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/styleguide/inclusive_code.md#racially-neutral)

Several of the examples above are drawn from these guides, and they also include
more detailed considerations.

Other organizations working on the same goal include:

* [NIST](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/25/agency-ends-use-technology-terms-racist-associations-339880)
* [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language)
* [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/2DZELQ4O)
* [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/leadership/biased-language-has-no-place-in-tech.html)
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221164)
