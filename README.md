# Inclusive Terminology in IETF Documents

Some choices of terminology that might seem harmless to some members of the community have painful connotations for others.  To ensure that the Internet standards process is open and welcoming for everyone, we should avoid such terminology in favor of more inclusive (and often more accurate!) options.  This document provides information on known problematic terms and suggested alternatives.

### Template

**Avoid:** (What terms should be avoided in IETF documents?)

**Better:** (What are better ways to express the same concept?)

(A brief note to explain why the terms are to be avoided / better choices.)

### Case 1

**Avoid:** master/slave

**Better:** leader/folloer, primary/secondary

(Explanatory note)

## Background: Elsewhere on the Internet

The IETF is not alone in trying to make its terminology more inclusive.  Some
peer organizations have published guidelines for writing more inclusive
documentation, for example:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TwitterEng/status/1278733305190342656)
* [Google](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation)
* [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/styleguide/inclusive_code.md#racially-neutral)

Other organizations working on the same goal include:

* [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/making-open-source-more-inclusive-eradicating-problematic-language)
* [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/2DZELQ4O)
* [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/leadership/biased-language-has-no-place-in-tech.html)
* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221164)
* [UK National Cyber Security Centre](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/terminology-its-not-black-and-white)
